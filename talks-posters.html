<h3 style="margin-top: -16px; margin-left: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Toward AI-driven genetic circuit design</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 14px;">Caleb Bashor (Rice University, USA)</p>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 14px;">Engineering synthetic regulatory circuits with precise input-output behavior—a central goal in synthetic biology—remains encumbered by the inherent molecular complexity of cells. Non-linear, high-dimensional interactions between genetic parts and host cell machinery make it difficult to design circuits using first principles biophysical models.  Adopting data-driven approaches that integrate modern machine learning (ML) tools and high-throughput experimental approaches into the synthetic biology design/build/test/learn process could dramatically accelerate the pace and scope of circuit design, yielding workflows that rapidly and systematically discern design principles and achieve quantitatively precise behavior. I will argue that the application of ML to circuit design can occur at three distinct scales, and describe work in my group making progress in each of them: 1) learning relationships between part sequence and function; 2) determining how part composition determines circuit behavior; 3) understanding how function varies with genomic/host-cell context. The work points toward a future where ML-driven genetic design is used to program robust solutions to complex problems across diverse biotechnology domains.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 14px;">Haiping Lu (University of Sheffield, UK)</p>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 14px;">Generative AI is opening new possibilities for protein design, while interaction screening remains essential for prioritising candidates in engineering biology workflows. In this talk, I will present generative and multimodal AI methods for protein sequence design and protein–ligand interaction screening. I will highlight a diffusion-based approach for structure-guided protein sequence design and an interpretable model for protein–small-molecule interaction screening. Together, these examples illustrate how multimodal representations, rigorous evaluation, benchmarking, and deployment-aware design are critical for translating AI advances into reliable design–screen pipelines for engineering biology.</p>

<p>Huimin Zhao (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)</p>
</summary>
<p>Synthetic biology aims to design novel or improved biological systems using engineering principles, which has broad applications in medical, chemical, food, and agricultural industries. Thanks to rapid advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis, genome editing, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), and laboratory automation, synthetic biology has entered a new phase of exponential growth. In this talk, I will highlight our recent work on the development of a self-driving biofoundry, AI/ML tools, non-model organisms, and novel enzymes for synthetic biology applications. Examples include but are not limited to: (a) BioAutomata: an AI-powered self-driving biofoundry for protein engineering, pathway engineering, and metabolic engineering in organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast to plant cells, (b) CLEAN: an AI tool for enzyme function prediction, (c) EZSpecificity: an AI tool for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, (d) engineered low-pH tolerant yeasts for cost-effective production of organic acids, and (e) repurposed enzymes with new-to-nature reactivity for asymmetric synthesis.</p>

<p>Jana M. Weber (TU Delft, The Netherlands)</p>
</summary>
<p>Designing sustainable molecules requires navigating vast design spaces with sparse information. In this talk, I will present key building blocks of molecular machine learning and show how they enable tailored exploration of chemical space. I will illustrate these concepts through two case studies. The first focuses on the design of photocatalytic polymers, highlighting challenges in polymer representation, predictive modelling with limited data, and inverse design strategies for discovering promising candidates. The second examines what is needed for reaction system evaluation and optimisation of these in vast chemical space.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: -16px; margin-left: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Cell-machine interfaces for control and learning</h3>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Lugagne (University of Oxford, UK)</p>
</summary>
<p>Engineering biology increasingly depends on the integration of data, models, and automation. Advances at the intersection of synthetic biology, control theory, and machine learning have led to the development of cell-machine interfaces: experimental platforms that directly couple living cells to computers through microfluidics, automated microscopy, and optogenetics. These cybergenetic systems establish a foundation for real-time learning and closed-loop control of cellular behaviour. In the first part of this talk, I will present how such interfaces have been used to dissect and manipulate antibiotic-resistance dynamics in bacteria. By combining data-driven control algorithms, high-throughput imaging, and single-cell optogenetics, we were able to precisely regulate gene expression in thousands of individual cells and generate rich datasets that reveal the regulatory principles underpinning tolerance and resistance acquisition. I will then describe how my group is extending this strategy to new biological systems and new application domains. In particular, I will present how we plan to use such platforms to emulate real-world, time-varying conditions in high throughput and at the microfluidic scale for training and validating predictive models, notably for biomanufacturing and scale-up. Finally, I will discuss how these interfaces create a bridge between biological experimentation and advanced AI/ML methods, and support autonomous experimentation and optimisation of biological systems. This work aims to establish experimental-computational infrastructures that enable AI to directly interact with, learn from, and ultimately design biological systems across scales.</p>

<p>Jeff Clune (University of British Columbia, Canada)</p>
</summary>
<p>Foundation models (e.g. large language models) create exciting new opportunities in our longstanding quests to produce open-ended and AI-generating algorithms, wherein agents can truly keep innovating and learning forever. In this talk, I will introduce quality diversity, open-ended, and AI-generating algorithms and share some of our recent work harnessing the power of foundation models to unleash their potential. I will cover our recent work including OMNI (Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness), Video Pre-Training (VPT), Automatically Designing Agentic Systems (ADAS), the Darwin Gödel Machine, and The AI Scientist.</p>

<p>Michiel Stock (Ghent University, Belgium)</p>
</summary>
<p>The goal of synthetic biology is to design new-to-nature components, pathways, and organisms, often by combining, adapting, or changing existing biological parts in creative ways. Any computational tools to aid the biodesign process must be flexible, composable, and adaptable, as biology itself is. Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a promising brain-inspired learning paradigm that leverages the peculiar properties of high-dimensional spaces. In this talk, we explore how HDC can be used to efficiently learn from multi-modal, structured data and generate interpretable, robust models for biodesign.</p>

<p>Niko McCarty (Asimov Press, USA)</p>
</summary>
<p>Our ability to predictably engineer biology will greatly improve in the 21st century, aided in part by AI. These advances could prove useful in creating a more flourishing future; not only for medicine, but also for animal welfare, terraforming planets, and so on. In this talk, I discuss two classes of bottlenecks that I think are limiting biology progress, explain how they are being solved today, and discuss the good outcomes which bioengineers can help build as a result.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: -16px; margin-left: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px;">RNA strand exchange circuits as a general-purpose molecular programming language for synthetic biology</h3>
<p>Samuel Schaffter (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA)</p>
</summary>
<p>A major goal of synthetic biology is to program biological systems with the same precision with which we program electronic devices, ultimately enabling the next generation of diagnostics, therapeutics, and biotechnologies. Great strides have been made, but a general challenge is most molecular programming paradigms are developed to operate in a narrow set of environments or applications. Further, sensing, information processing, and signal transduction are often coupled within a single device or design, making interoperability difficult. In contrast, in electronic computing inputs are converted into a universal machine language for information processing, and outputs of the machine instructions are mapped back to an application specific response. This enables seamless communication and integration across devices and applications. To enable similarly broad programmability of biological systems, we are developing a molecular equivalent of these machine instructions based on genetically encoded RNA strand exchange circuits called ctRSD circuits. RNA strand exchange reactions are easily programmed via predictable base pairing interactions universal across cell types, enabling wide operability. Further, in vitro nucleic acid strand exchange reactions are the most scalable and programmable biomolecular systems to date, demonstrating, for example, neural network-based classification of hundreds of inputs. I will provide an overview of our work operating ctRSD circuits across different environments and connecting these RNA circuits to different classes of inputs (metabolites and proteins) and outputs (proteins). Lastly, I will discuss the additional measurements needed to fully characterize circuit performance and properly inform AI/ML models that could ultimately automate the molecular circuit design process.</p>
